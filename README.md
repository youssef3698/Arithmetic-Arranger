# Arithmetic-Arranger
Arithmetic Arranger project for FreeCodeCamp.org Scientific Computing with Python course.

This is the first project I created on my own.

I created this on 24/09/2022 for my certification requirement from FreeCodeCamp.org.

I assume there is a lot of ways to make the code more efficient and avoid unnecessary calculation.

I welcome any help I can receive, I might revisit the code after I have more experience with Python.

Thank you for the time you put in checking the code or contributing to it.

Have a great day.
